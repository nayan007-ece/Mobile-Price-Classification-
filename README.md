# Mobile-Price-Classification-
Price is the most effective attribute of marketing and business. The very first question of customer is about the price of items. All the customers are first worried and thinks “If he would be able to purchase something with given specifications or not”. The price of a product is the most important attribute of marketing that product.  One of those products where price matters a lot is a smartphone because it comes with a lot of features so that a company thinks a lot about how to price this  mobile which can justify the features and also cover the marketing and manufacturing costs of the mobile. 
In this project, We have designed a model on mobile price classification with Machine Learning using Python.


APPROACH ADOPTED: 

With the given data set to get better idea of mobile price, we adopted various classifications/clustering algorithms and try to find out which classifier gives the 
best accuracy/score according to given data.


RESULT:

On applying various classifications/clustering algorithms, we found that SVM Linear Kernel Classifier has highest Accuracy/Score.
